My main research areas are `railway electrification (OLE)` , `solid mechanics`, `finite element method`, `fatigue` and `material's metallurgy`.

Beside my work, I built an platform named [Mechead.com](http://www.mechead.com) five years ago, which has been voluntarily serving for those who are in search of different things whats and whys in engineering area since it was found.
