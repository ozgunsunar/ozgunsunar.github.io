An engineering based academic, working at ESTU. My main research areas are `railway electrification (OLE)` , `solid mechanics`, `finite element method`, `fatigue` and `material's metallurgy`. Tell the world about yourself. 

Please check my agenda to see my availability and welcome to drop me an email for your further questions. Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
