	abstract = {Fatigue in railway overhead line electrification (OLE) contact wires can cause sudden catastrophic failures. The contact wire interacting with the pantograph both mechanically and electrically is subjected to tension and repetitive bending due to the pantograph contact force. Recently, fatigue failures of OLE have risen in prominence with increases in train speed. To address this a new fatigue test configuration has been developed. The study focuses on a method for testing the wire as a component enabling fatigue life evaluation of worn wires, or exploring the effect of installation damage, through component level evaluation of crack initiation and propagation. The new test configuration places a 400 mm-length contact wire in a combination of bending and pretension with realistic boundary conditions replicating service conditions for longer spans. The results are presented in a strain-life format to provide data for a wide range of potential service conditions.},

	abstract={Contact wires are subjected to both mechanical and electrical interactions while electrical energy is transmitted to the trains by overhead lines and train pantographs. Particularly, an increase in the speed of trains can result in greater contact force fluctuations and more intense pantograph arcs, therefore, these mechanical and electrical interactions have potential to drive failure of Overhead Line Equipment (OLE) conductors. In this paper, the effect on fatigue crack initiation risk of material ablation from the contact wire surface due to arc discharge is experimentally investigated under laboratory conditions. Fatigue life, crack propagation directions and crack initiation locations in arc-exposed copper silver contact wire samples are compared with those in comparable arc-free samples. The results show that under the conditions of having arc damage on the contact wire surface could result in 50 per cent shorter fatigue life compared to arc-free contact wires. It is often considered that wear rather than fatigue cracking defines the life of the contact wires, but under some conditions with the combination of arcing, the fatigue life in the contact wire can become the controlling failure risk. Therefore, in determining system life and maintenance requirements the fatigue life of the contact wire should be taken into consideration at locations where the arc discharge is likely.},

	abstract={Railway overhead line electrification (OLE) is used for providing continuous power to the trains throughout catenary wires and the current collector device of the pantograph. The interaction of contact force exerted by the pantograph and contact wire is an important topic in regulating OLE dynamics. OLE components are subjected to fluctuating contact forces due to the trains running with high speed, therefore, it is important to estimate service life of contact wires and pantograph carbon collectors by considering contact wire/pantograph interference. This study performs a number of contact force and stress/strain analysis of standard OLE designs used in Europe, Series 1, Sicat S1.0, Sicat H1.0, Re250 and EAC 350, with finite element method. The results establish a link between stress levels and contact force in the contact lines depending on the design parameters of contact wire type, pretension, span-length, and contact wire material. Understanding the bending of the contact wire due to the contact force will help to predict potential failures in mainlines and extend our knowledge of safety and reliability of various OLE design parameters.},
